# Portfolio Website (Ameen)
Portfolio showcasing a few examples of my projects, originally utilized an HTML5 Boilerplate, however, the animations needed improvement, therefore, I utilized CSS and JavaScript (style.css and particle.js) to sculpt the front-end to my liking.

## The Problem
Personally, I found that the most difficult portion of this personal project was the prospect of deploying it. Since it's a task I am not comfortable with, it proves to be incredibly daunting. That being said, I really enjoyed putting together the animations as well as the structure overall.

However, there are miniscule errors, such as certain animations that start when the website initially loads, rather than starting ONLY when a user is on the page, but I will slowly improve on the portfolio, and look forward to deploying it soon!

Until then, here is a short video purely showcasing some interesting portions of the portfolio!
